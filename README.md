# Building AI Products, Final project
## Overview

A Shopping Assistant application developed as part of the final project, using the RAG architecture to provide users with a personalized 
shopping experience. This tool aggregates data from a store database to help customize shopping lists based on user preferences and needs, 
offering tailored recommendations and insights to help users make informed purchasing decisions.

## Data Source

The application utilizes the Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is in CSV format and includes detailed 
information about 8,494 products with 27 variables, such as:
* `Name`
* `Size`
* `Price`
* `Rating`
* `Category`
* `Ingredients`

## Use Case: Allergy Considerations

The database includes over 400 products containing salicylic acid. For users with allergies, this assistant can:

* Quickly identify products containing specific ingredients.
* Suggest alternatives that do not contain allergens, enhancing the shopping experience and preventing bad purchases.
